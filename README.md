Ship Instance Segmentation Network for SAR and Optical Images Based on MobileViT-v3

Ship instance segmentation technology plays an important role in numerous fields such as maritime safety and monitor, intelligent shipping, marine environmental protection, and maritime emergency rescue. However, the ocean environment is typically complex, and the characteristics of ship targets vary significantly, making ship instance segmentation a challenging task.To overcome these difficulties, the paper proposes MDFNet, a novel single-stage instance segmentation network designed based on MobileViT-v3, which mixes convolutional mechanisms with Transformer mechanisms. The backbone network of MDFNet incorporates the CpnMvitbv3 module, which fuses MobileViT-v3, enhancing the understanding of spatial relationships between objects through explicit global attention. The CpnMvitbv3 module excels at extracting local features while effectively capturing global information, ensuring effective use of multi-scale information.In the neck, DODConv's use of dynamic weights is beneficial for handling complex backgrounds and multi-scale objects. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss function, Focal-SIoU, to handle challenging samples, manage complex backgrounds, improve small object detection performance, and optimize boundary precision.We conducted comprehensive comparisons with advanced instance segmentation models on two datasets: SSDD (SAR) and MarShipInsSeg (visible light). Experimental results display that MDFNet achieves an average precision (AP) of 63.8 and 49.4 on the SSDD and MarShipInsSeg datasets, surpassing the next-best models, Hybrid Task Cascade and Yolact by 2.7 and 5.8 percentage points, respectively, with particularly outstanding performance on SAR images. The results further demonstrate that MDFNet significantly enhances ship target segmentation accuracy, showcasing strong adaptability and consistent performance across different datasets and environments.
